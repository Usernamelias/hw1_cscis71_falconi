# Assignment 1: Set up your development environment 

I ran the program with a command line argument from within IntelliJ and the terminal. 
On IntelliJ, I edited the program configurations and added my name for the argument. 
For the terminal, I changed my directory to the location of HelloWorld.class, and ran the commands "java HelloWorld" and "java HelloWorld Elias" to show how the program runs with and without an argument. 

All necessary screenshots are included.
